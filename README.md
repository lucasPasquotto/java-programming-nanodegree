Udacity nanodegree for Java Programming course

Lesson 1: Introduction to Java
In this lesson, we covered some fundamentals—such as why you would want to learn Java, and what prerequisites you needed to succeed in the course.

Lesson 2: Java Basics
This lesson covered all the major building blocks we needed to create a simple Java app, including keywords, variables, loops, methods, access modifiers, arrays, and Javadoc.

Lesson 3: Defining Classes
In this lesson, we learned about what an object is, what a class is, and how we can create (or instantiate) objects from classes.

Lesson 4: Object-Oriented Programming
In this lesson, we went deeper into objects and classes and learned about some of the advanced concepts of object-oriented programming, including inheritance and polymorphism.

Lesson 5: Common Types
We learned about some of the important class types provided by the Java API, including Exceptions, Enums, RegEx, Dates and Calendar, and advanced String features. We saw that these types help us do a number of very useful things, such as handling errors, looking for string patterns, and storing and retrieving dates.

Lesson 6: Generics and Collections
Working with multiple types can introduce some challenges. In this lesson we learned how two tools—generics and collections—can help us address these challenges and make our code type-safe.

Lesson 7: Advanced Collections
In this lesson we learned about some additional, more advanced types of collections: Maps, Sets and Queues. We saw that each of these provides a uniquely powerful—and more efficient—data structure for specific scenarios we commonly encounter when programming
